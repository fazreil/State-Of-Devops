# Environment

---

## Environments that we deal with have

- DEV
- SIT
- UAT
- Pre-PROD
- PROD

---

# Build Process

---

## Basic Build Process

Follow the conventional Maven Build Lifecycle


1. validate
1. compile
1. test
1. package
1. verify
1. install
1. deploy

---

## Additional processes

1. Static Analysis
1. Sonar Scan
1. Deploy to artifactory
1. Deploy to environment
1. Archive artifacts
1. Update/Feedback work item

## Build lifecycle

Suggested Build Lifecycle:

- Deploy to DEV every hour
- Deploy to SIT <a style="color:#00FF00">by request</a>
- Deploy to UAT <a style="color:#00FF00">by request</a>
- Deploy to Pre-Prod <a style="color:#FF0000">Never</a>
- Deploy to Pre-Prod <a style="color:#FF0000">Never</a>

# Build Mechanism

---

## Build mechanism involves a few ways to achieve them
- Using jenkins slave for preprovisioning
- Using jenkins slave for build
- Using jenkins slave for deployment

---

### pre provisioning slaves
- for configuring/shaping the environment node for the said target deployment
- less usage in daily task, may act as a spare build slave
- must have connectivity with artifactory

---

### build slaves
- for building maven and npm projects.
- high usage daily task.
- must have connectivity with artifactory

---

### deployment slaves
- Slaves available

---

# workflows

<Workflow src="[Jenkins]->[Artifactory] -> [Test environment]" />

---

# GIT Workflows

<Workflow src="[Start]->[Finish]" />

---

# The End
