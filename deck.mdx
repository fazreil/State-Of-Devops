# Build Mechanism

---

## Build mechanism involves a few ways to achieve them
- Using jenkins slave for preprovisioning
- Using jenkins slave for build
- Using jenkins slave for deployment

---

### pre provisioning slaves
- for configuring/shaping the environment node for the said target deployment
- less usage in daily task, may act as a spare build slave
- must have connectivity with artifactory

---

### build slaves
- for building maven and npm projects.
- high usage daily task.
- must have connectivity with artifactory

---

### deployment slaves
- Slaves available
