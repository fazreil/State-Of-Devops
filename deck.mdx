- deploy (ansible script)
- plan (jira & confluence)

---

### We don't have

- operate (orangmatic)

# Environment

---

## Environments that we have

- DEV       (our control)
- SIT       (Not our control)
- UAT       (Not our control)
- Pre-PROD  (Not our control)
- PROD      (Never touch this)

# Build Process

---

## Basic Build Process

Follow the conventional Maven Build Lifecycle

- Clean
- Download dependencies

---

## Additional processes in Build Process (1/2)
- Compile source
- Compile test
- Unit test
- Package
- Install

---

## Additional processes in Build Process (2/2)
- Static Analysis
- Sonar Scan
- Deploy to artifactory
- Deploy to DEV environment
- Archive artifacts

# Build Lifecycle

Build setup/Build mechanism

---

## Build lifecycle
- Deploy to DEV every hour
- Deploy to SIT <a style="color:#00FF00">by request</a>
- Deploy to UAT <a style="color:#00FF00">by request</a>

---

## Build mechanism involves a few ways to achieve them
- Using jenkins slave for preprovisioning
- Using jenkins slave for build
- Using jenkins slave for deployment

---

### pre provisioning slaves
- Slaves available

### build slaves
- Slaves available

---

### deployment slaves
- Slaves available
